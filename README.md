Assignment 1 for Object Orientated Programming

My Project uses Data from the Acheivement Hunter Youtube Channel https://www.youtube.com/user/AchievementHunter
My project will use the subscribers gained and views recieved for the channel over 90 days
I plan to do some simple line graphs a scatterplot diagram and then try make a diagram unuiqe to my project but I am unsure as to what that will be right now.

Final Results.

It came out pretty much as expected I ended up going for a unuiqe bubble graph to look like a solar system so that the point orbited the centre of the graph
